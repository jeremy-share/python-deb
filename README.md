# Python Deb

This project is an example of packaging a Python application into a `.deb` (Debian) package.

## Scratch
[docker-compose-scratch.yml](docker-compose-scratch.yml) and [Dockerfile.scratch](Dockerfile.scratch) are examples of 
running it inside a Docker FROM scratch container; however, there could probably be room for improvement
